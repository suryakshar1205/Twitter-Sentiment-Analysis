Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression
This repository contains the code and model for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the Kaggle Sentiment140 dataset. The project utilizes Logistic Regression, TF-IDF Vectorization, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments.

Overview
In this project, we preprocess raw tweet data from the Sentiment140 dataset, clean it by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, and then apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert the text into numerical features. A Logistic Regression model is then trained to classify the sentiments of the tweets.

The final model is saved as a Pickle file for future use, allowing for easy loading and prediction on new tweet data.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Model Training: Utilizes Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts tweet text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
Model Evaluation: Provides accuracy scores on training and testing data.
Model Saving: The trained model is saved as a Pickle file for deployment or further use.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
numpy - For numerical operations.
pandas - For data manipulation.
scikit-learn - For machine learning algorithms and metrics.
nltk - For natural language processing.
pickle - For saving and loading the trained model.

## **How to Use**
1. **Dataset:** Download the **Sentiment140 dataset** from Kaggle:
2. **Preprocessing & Model Training:**
   - Run the `sentiment140_analysis.py` script to preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.
3. **Prediction:**
   - Use the saved model (`twitter_model.sav`) to predict the sentiment of new tweets.
   - Load the model using `pickle` and call the `predict` method on new text data.
## **Future Scope**
- **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis:** Extend the model to support multiple languages.
- **Real-Time Twitter API Integration:** Implement real-time sentiment analysis by fetching live tweets using the Twitter API.
- **Advanced Models:** Experiment with deep learning models like **BERT** or **GPT** to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.
